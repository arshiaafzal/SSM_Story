LION-D performs comparably to Vim and surpasses Hydra <d-cite key="hwang2025hydra"></d-cite>, while training approximately 7x faster than Vim <d-cite key="zhu2024vision"></d-cite>. Notably, LION-üî• demonstrates the highest training speed across all models, showing that training with Full Linear Attention is significantly faster than chunkwise parallel training (used in Hydra) and considerably faster than the scan algorithm, even with optimized GPU kernels (as used in Vim). \(LION-S^{\natural}\) and \(LION-D^{\natural}\) modify the order of patches in an image to better capture the locality inherent in spatial patterns. By rearranging the patch sequence, these models enhance their understanding of local structures while still leveraging the efficiency of Linear Attention mechanisms similar to xLSTM <d-cite key="alkin2024vision"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="memory-efficiency">Memory Efficiency</h3> <p>The LION family demonstrates excellent memory efficiency across both vision and language tasks. Figure below shows inference memory usage with a batch size of 64 across different image resolutions, LION models (RNN form) maintain reasonable memory consumption even at high resolutions up to 2496 pixels, while adding minimal training overhead in BERT-style language modeling scenarios.

We will look at three key approaches:</p> <ol> <li>Full Linear Attention - The standard approach using the Full Attention matrix.</li> <li>Bidirectional RNN - Our memory-efficient RNN formulation.</li> <li>LION Chunk - A balanced approach using chunked computation.</li> </ol> <h3 id="memory-vs-speed-trade-offs">Memory vs Speed Trade-offs</h3> <p>The first plot below shows how these approaches compare in terms of memory efficiency and inference speed in LION-D. The RNN approach proves to be the most memory-efficient, while Full Attention uses the most memory. LION Chunk provides a nice middle ground - it uses less memory than Full Attention while actually achieving faster inference speeds than both alternatives. This makes it particularly attractive when you need to balance performance with resource constraints.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/SSM_Story/assets/img/fig3_plot.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/SSM_Story/assets/img/fig3_plot.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Impact of Chunk Size" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Analysis of how chunk size affects model performance across different LION-D variants.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>For LION-üî•, we see a similar pattern, but the chunking approach is even more pronounced.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/SSM_Story/assets/img/linear_chunking.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/SSM_Story/assets/img/linear_chunking.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Linear Chunking Analysis" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Evaluation of linear chunking strategies and their impact on model efficiency of LION-üî•.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Lastly for LION-S, we see that the chunking approach is only faster at lower resolutions - at higher resolutions, the overhead from mask calculations starts to slow it down.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/SSM_Story/assets/img/selective_chunking.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/SSM_Story/assets/img/selective_chunking.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Selective Chunking Analysis" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Performance comparison of selective chunking approaches across different sequence lengths with LION-S.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Expanding LION‚Äôs Potential:</strong> Our experiments focused on three main mask choices, but LION has the potential to accelerate other Linear Transformer variants for bidirectional tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Optimizing Chunkwise Parallelism:</strong> The chunkwise parallel implementation during inference was done in PyTorch, with room for optimization through GPU kernel programming to reduce I/O overhead and improve speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stabilizing Hydra and Mamba with LION:</strong> Hydra <d-cite key="hwang2025hydra"></d-cite> and Mamba <d-cite key="gu2023mamba"></d-cite> activations led to unstable training under Full Attention, suggesting LION could be used to stabilize these variants in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <h1 id="last-points">Last Points</h1> <p>We encourage the readers of this blog post to read the full <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.16249">paper</a> for more details about the LION framework and experimental setups.
